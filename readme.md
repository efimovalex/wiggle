# 🖱️ Wiggle

**Wiggle** is a tiny utility that keeps your computer awake by gently wiggling the mouse cursor every few seconds.  
Perfect for staying online during meetings, avoiding idle status in work chats, preventing screen lock, dodging AFK kicks in GeForce Now, or just vibing during idle time.

## 📦 Installation

### Via Go

```bash
$ CGO_ENABLE=1 go install github.com/efimovalex/wiggle@latest

$ wiggle &

```

## 🧠 Usage
1. Start the script.
2. Let the cursor do the hustle.
3. Wiggling pauses on:
    - Any mouse movement or action
    - Any keyboard key press
4. If idle for 30 seconds, it resumes automatically.
5. To stop wiggling, simply close the script or use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
6. To run it in the background, use `wiggle &`. Use `fg` to bring it back to the foreground or `kill` to stop it.

## 🐛 Issues

To enable alerts on macOS (they are there but just not allowed), open Script Editor and run the following command:
```
display notification "Hello World" with title "My Title"
```

This will ask for permission to send notifications
After that, you can run the program and it will send notifications when the wiggler is toggled
